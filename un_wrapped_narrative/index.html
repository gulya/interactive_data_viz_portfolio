          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">Every December Spotify releases Spotify Wrapped, a year end summary of music (and now podcasts) we have listened to during the previous years. 
            While I do listen to quite a bit of music still, I don't really consider myself a person who is "really into music" anymore. I listen to some new releases,
          but primarily stick to my favorite albums and artists. I don't feel that I need to be up to date with music either and I am fine just listening to what I like.  </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">While reviewing my Wrapped from 2021, I became curious to how, if at all my listening habits were different now than they were
          when I was a teenager who prided herself in having impecabbale music taste. Thankfully, I was able to uncover my listening data from my youth via
          <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">last.fm</span>, which surprisingly had all of my data saved and ready to be downloaded.
           </p>

          <p>I wanted to explore how my listening habbits have changed compared to this years <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">Spotify Wrapped</span>, which actually came out
          while I was putting this project together, which also simplified my approach to the project. I focus on the summer 2007 to summer 2008 for this analysis, since that encompases a full academic year (a year increment
        that was more relevant to me in high school that a calendar year) and the data was the cleanest for this time period. This period also coinsided with the first year back at home in Uzbekistan, after returning from a year of study abroad in the US during high school.
      I think that being as exchange student during the previous year introduced me to a variety of new artists and expanded my taste.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">Spotify wrapped is designed for viral marketing, highlighting data points that users would want to share online with their friends.
          It also has become standardized, with a goal of users comparing themselves to their friends by sharing the results of their Wrapped online </p>

            <div class="caption">
              Spotify Wrapped is a <span style="background-color: #C0AFCE;">viral marketing campaign by Spotify</span>. Released in early December every year since 2016, the campaign allows Spotify users to view a <span style="background-color: #C0AFCE;">compilation of data about their activity</span> on the platform over the past year, then invites them to share it on social media.

          While Spotify Wrapped is "personalized" based on your listening history, the narrative that is created is identical for each user of the platform.
          Everyone is the main character of their own movie. Are we still individually different if we all receive the same narrative?

          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;"> In 2021, I listened to <span class="one" style="background-color:  #C0AFCE; ">22,231 minutes</span> 
          on Spotify, which includes both podcasts and music. I estimate that I listen to poscasts approximately half of the time now, given the fact that 
        I listen to The Daily, Up First, Who? Weekly and all the popular cult- or scam- based podcasts that are in the zeitgeist.</p>

          <br />&nbsp;
          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;"> This means that in 2021, I listened to approximately 1,000 minutes of music every month. Looking at the data of my youth,
          I see that I have listened to <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">3,560 minutes </span> on average every month. I suspected that I spent more of my time listening to music, because I used to listen to music while 
          doing homework (which occupied the most of my time) or when hiding from my family and being anti-social. It is still a surpising amount of time, given that I did not have access to a ubiquity of an iPhone and was primarily listening on iTunes while on my computer. </p>

          <p>What surpised me also, is looking at April 2008 and seeing so much time listening to music: listening to 1193 artists across 189 albums is a lot! I wasnted to further
            breakdown these months by the top artists that I listened to and see whether I was exploring new music or re-listening to my usuals. </p>
            <br />&nbsp;
            <p>It does look like that in April, I did dig into the discography of my favorite artists. For example, I listened to a whooping 7 albums by <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">Radiohead</span>, whereas in other months during the time period
              I listen to one or two albums. Similarly, while <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">Rufus Wainwright</span> was a favorite, I listened to all 5 of his albums. Thinking about what might have lead to such interest in digging deep into artists geographies,
              the only thing I can think of is that it was close to the end of the semester and I was probably preparing for exams and finals.

          <p>Every year Spotify also provides you with the top artists chart. In 2021, my top artists looked somewhat embarassing (it was after all, the year I became a <span style="background-color: #C0AFCE;">Swiftie?</span>)
            I think it is fair to say that my music taste is much less hip nowadays, and I stay away from listening to Pitchfork darlings and stick to female pop stars and ocasionally Broadway showtunes (also a recent discovery).

          <p>My top songs in 2021 were primarily by <span class="one" style="background-color:  #C0AFCE; ">Olivia Rodrigo</span> (I think because she reminds me of <span class="one" style="background-color: #3C01E2; color:white;">Paramore and Avril Lavigne</span> of my youth). 
            My top 5 songs of my youth were less pop-y and more indie. Relistening to them, I do think they are more mellow and more melodic, blending in more seamlessly when trying to solve problem sets, putting together reports or even reading.

        <p style="margin-bottom:2em;"> At the end of the year Spotify also makes a playlist with 100 songs that emcompass the full year. I wanted to do the same here. 
          Expanding beyond the top 5 and looking through the top 100 of the songs that I listened to the most, I am struck that I cannot recognize most.
        There are familiar artists, for sure, but less than half bring out specific memories. </p>
