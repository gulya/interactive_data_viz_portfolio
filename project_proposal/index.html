    <h3>Interactive Data Visualization: Project Prospectus</h3>
    <h4>Ideation</h4>
    <p> During this phase, I explored ideas and datasets I've been thinking about and collecting
      over the course of years. Below were several ideas I've thought about
      <ul>
        <li><b>Personal connected health devices:</b> I have an activity tracking device that tracks
          my sleep, rest, heartrate and activity level. The is supposed to provide proactive recommendations
          with a goal of improving sleep, rest and making excercise sessions more effectice. 
          Additionally, this device also is connected to my Peloton, which allows me to see how effective my workouts were.
          I wanted to see if, over the course of the last two years, I am actually getting better at getting adequate sleep
          and whether my workouts are becoming more effective.
        </li>
        <li><b>H1-B visas: </b> USCIS data on H1-B visa applications is publically available. As someone who moved
          to the US for college and having to go through the process of applying for employment-based visa,
          I am curious about the profile of applicants. Are there industries that have more H1-B based workers? 
          Given that there are more applicants that visas available, I am also curious what are the industuries
          that have higher probability of securing work visas versus professionals who are unable to receive work authorization
          and are unable to work in the US. There are a lot of anecdotal data I've heard about the employment-based visas over the years,
          and I am curious to know whether that is supported by actual data.
        </li>
        <li><b>What happened to my favorite bands? </b>I think my music taste peaked when I was 16-18. I recently discovered that 
          I still have access to the logs of music I listened to in 2007-2010, since I used <a href="https://last.fm/">last.fm</a> and they still have that data.
          I am curious to understand, what kind of music was I really into back then? How obscure were there bands? To me, it seems
          that my music taste was really obscure and "cool", but how true is that? I am also curious to understand, have I re-visited any of my 
          youth favorites in the last 10 years?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Refinement</h4>
    <p>I decided to go with the third idea, motivated by the fact that I now work at Spotify, and understanding my own
      history of music appreciation would be great. Additionally, I <i>think</i> that I easily access my personal listening on 
      Spotify, so I can compare what I was listening 10 years ago, to what I listen to know.
    </p>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>My approach is a narrative data viz project that will paint a picture of music I liked, and what was my music taste like.
      Within this narrative, I want to focus on the following questions:
    </p>
    <li>What were my favorite bands / artists? Potentially plotting either a monthly area chart of total streamcounts for top artists, or a summarized 
      bar chart over the course of those 3 years.
    </li>
    <li>What generes of music did I listen to? Is my hunch that my taste used to be more diverse and not as much driven
      by Lana/Taylor/Phoebe as they are today correct?
    </li>
    <li>Did I used to listen to more music on a daily basis than I do now?</li>
    <li>How often do I now revisit my favorites from 10 years ago?</li>
